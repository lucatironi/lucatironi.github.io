## Processing Details

I stacked the lights frames in [Siril](https://siril.org/) using the [OSC Preprocessing Without DBF (Darks, Biases, Flats)](https://free-astro.org/index.php?title=Siril:scripts) script. I decided not to use any Dark, Bias or Flat frames. I might try to create a dark frame library later, but the ASI533MC-Pro is considered a camera that can do without darks given the absence of amp glow.

I tried to process the image to replicate the so called "Hubble Palette" where Hydrogen gas usually has a orange hue and Oxygen gas is blue. At the bottom of the page there is an example of the same image but processed in a more "natural" way, where the nebula is appearing only red.

I then used the following tools:
- Photometric Color Calibration
- Remove Green Noise
- Generalized Hyperbolic Stretch (GHS) Transformations
- StarNet Star removal
- Split Channels
- RGB Compositing (Luminance->Red, Red->Red, Green->Red, Blue->Green)
- Color Saturation
- Star Recomposition with some stretching and reduction of the starmask
