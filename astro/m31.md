  The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31 is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years from Earth and the nearest large galaxy to our own Milky Way. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy)

## Description

This is the first image I took with my rig after moving to the countryside and upgrading to the [SkyWatcher EQ6R-Pro](http://www.skywatcher.com/product/eq6r-pro/) mount. Setting up the equipment, focusing and doing the polar aligment with the ASIAIR Pro was straightforward and didn't take too long.

I then used the Go-To function from the Sky Atlas on the ASIAIR to slew and then frame the Andromeda Galaxy. It felt even too easy! I decided to take 5 minutes long exposures and at least 12 of them, for an hour of total integration.

## Acquisition Details

| **Guide Scope** | Angeleyes Mini Guidescope 30mm f/4 |
| **Guide Camera** | ZWO ASI 120MM mini |
| **Computer** | ZWO ASIAIR Pro |

## Processing Details

I stacked the ligths frames in [Siril](https://siril.org/) using the [OSC Preprocessing Without DBF (Darks, Biases, Flats)](https://free-astro.org/index.php?title=Siril:scripts) script. I decided not to use any Dark, Bias or Flat frames. I might try to create a dark frame library later, but the ASI533MC-Pro is considered a camera that can do without darks given the absence of amp glow.

I then used the following tools:
- Photometric Color Calibration
- Asinh Transformation (stretch 768.2, black point 0.003)
- Histogram Transformation (mid 0.341, low 0.013, high 1.000)
- Saturation enhancement (amount 0.13)
