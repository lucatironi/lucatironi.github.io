        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          As a <strong>Manager</strong> I strive to structure processes to help people to excel in creating and innovating. I have scaled engineering teams and supported the company to acquire and retain the best talents. I organized teams to be Agile, independent and autonomous.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a <strong>Technical Leader</strong> I believe in the power of collaboration and problem solving. I have built both simple and complex systems from the ground up. I also led refactoring of legacy systems and structured methodologies to maintain and expand complex architectures.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an <strong>Engineer</strong> I write tested, readable and efficient code. I can work from the frontend layer (CSS, HTML, JS) to the depths of the backend (Ruby, Go, Microservices, API) and I have experience in DevOps as well (Docker, Cloud, Scaling, CI/CD).
        </p>
        <p>
          As an <strong>Entrepreneur</strong> I want to use my technical perspective together with my business experience to create new and compelling products.
